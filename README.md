Could unfortunatly not implement anything other than easing in the project im working on :( 

The idea for a complete gameloop would be to have the player presented with a list of colors, they would then shoot the context actors when they are at a certain position to lock their color.

Didnt know how to fit noise into this loop so i just added screenshake with perlin noise
